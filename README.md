THE NEW VERSION CAN BE FOUND HERE: [https://github.com/rebasedata/php-client](https://github.com/rebasedata/php-client)


Installation via Composer
-------------------------

The recommended method to install is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

1. Add `rebasedata/php-client` as a dependency in your project's `composer.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "require": {
            "rebasedata/php-client": "*"
        }
    }
    ```

2. Download and install Composer:

    ```bash
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    ```

3. Install your dependencies:

    ```bash
    php composer.phar install
    ```

4. Require Composer's autoloader

    Composer also prepares an autoloader file that helps to autoload the libraries it downloads. To use it, just add the following line to your application:

    ```php
    <?php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

    use RebaseData\Client;

    $client = new Client('freemium');
    ```
You can find out more about Composer at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org).


Example
-------

The following code is an example on how to convert a Microsoft Access ACCDB file to a ZIP-archive of CSV files. You can replace 'freemium' with the Customer Key that you purchased.

```php
use RebaseData\Client;

$client = new Client('freemium');

$inputFiles = ['/tmp/access.accdb'];

$outputFile = $client->convertAndReceiveZip($inputFiles);

echo "Conversion successful, check out $outputFile!\n";
```
